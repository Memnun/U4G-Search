Hello yes I made this search engine
Hi, I am Cadorean on the MSPA Forums and n0c00l on tumblr, do with that as you will
This search engine is a quick and dirty solution to a problem posed by OldManRupee
To use the search engine simply run the python script by double clicking, and wait for the archival process to complete (to be optimized)
Once it has finished archiving, you have three options for search criteria: Username of poster, keywords within the post, and date range of when it was posted. All searches are case sensitive for capitalization, and all searches are punctuation specific.
For keyword search, to fully optimize your search experience, there are some tricks. If you are unsure about the state of capitalization on a certain word, and you want that word in a match all search, do one search with your other words first, matching all, then search keywords again to pare down your results further, enter any possible capitalizations, and match any. This will result in any capitalization you defined of that word getting searched. If you are unsure of capitalization for a word in a set of search terms match any, simply enter all potential capitalizaitons in your match any search.
