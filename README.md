Hello yes I made this search engine
Hi, I am Cadorean on the MSPA Forums and n0c00l on tumblr, do with that as you will
This search engine is a quick and dirty solution to a problem posed by OldManRupee
To use the search engine simply run the python script by double clicking, and wait for the archival process to complete (to be optimized)
Once it has finished archiving, you have three options for search criteria: Username of poster, keywords within the post, and date range of when it was posted. All searches are case sensitive for capitalization, and all searches are punctuation specific.
The date range search is still buggy -- most of the time it culls everything from the results. Use at your own discretion.
Currently the "match all" keyword search culls the list to 0. Do not use.
