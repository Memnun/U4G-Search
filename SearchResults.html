							So occasionally I come up with ideas for forum adventures, but don't have the time or inclination to do them. When this happens, I'll shove the idea up here and someone else can use it as their own! So if you've got time on your hands but no inspiration, keep checking back here! Here's a couple of ideas to start us off:<br />
<br />
Picture the scene; the day has been won, the ancient evil has been sealed away by the guild of wise elders with the help of the ultimate weapon. But now that peace is at hand, you, the last Elder to go to his eternal rest, still has a task to complete. It has been forseen that the Evil will arise again in 100 years time, and a plucky hero will need to find the Ultimate Weapon to defeat him again. But how will the Weapon stay safe all that time? Its time to get DUNGEON BUILDING AND PUZZLE-TRAIL BLAZING.<br />
<br />
Also, I had a vague idea about the guy who caught Guy Fawkes (Sir Thomas Knyvet, thanks Wikipedia) is tasked with forever patrolling the cellars of Parliament to protect the world above, and years later his descendants police the entire under-city of London, whose cellars and sewers have been expanded and connected over the years.<br />
<br />
Feel free to steal these as your own, or add your own up-for-grabs ideas!<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />

Here's some links to all the adventures (I know of) that have started from this thread! Please PM me if you took an idea from here and don't appear in the following list:<br />

							<b>The Yarn Spinners</b><br />
A group of regulars, sat round the bar listening to the chill wind outside and warming their hands at the fire, strike up a wager. Whosoever tells the best legend, story, or saga will get their tabs cleared by the others. The barmaid listens in, and agrees to be the impartial judge.<br />
<br />
Its a way for suggesters to build up lots of short-form stories, and maybe they can play against each other!
						</p><h2>02-02-2011</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							Those are slightly creepy, but all the cooler for it!<br />
<br />
Anyway new idea: an adventure based on the awesome DS game Ghost Trick. It would be splendid.
						</p><h2>02-15-2011</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							<b>NPC-venture</b>: What does an &quot;average townsperson&quot; do in between telling the Hero his one useful line? He can only walk around one videogame town, he HAS to say his line to the Hero no matter what he wants to actually say, and he finds that damn line is creeping into his everyday conversation with the other NPCs.<br />
<br />
I'd throw in some other stuff like a love interest NPC who's tragically got too stuck in her ways, some interesting friendships/rivalry with other NPCs, and when the Hero FINALLY moves the story along a bit in the game you're allowed to do something different, but thats not very often (stupid compelling sidequests). Maybe you're desperately waiting for the story to move along enough for the love interest's line to change so she becomes unstuck?
						</p><h2>02-24-2011</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							Comic Books R Us<br />
<br />
You've just started your own comic book company! Yay! Now to think up some heroes and sell some comics! Theres a points system for how popular your comics get, which directly effects your resources available and the expansion of your company. <br />
Watch out for the rival company across the street that keeps &quot;borrowing&quot; your office supplies, and the major comics labels that keep trying to kill you and make your death look like an accident! And just how do you find good artists and writers nowadays anyway?

							<b>Life In Ruins</b><br />
You're an archeologist with a special power: Touch an artifact to see a vision of the past! Use these visions to solve a long-since-dead WW1 murder mystery and follow the story of a doomed Victorian couple, whilst in the present your colleagues get suspicious of your hands-on approach!
						</p><h2>03-30-2011</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							Oh my god, these ideas. I don't know whether to cry, or be proud that I started it all. Hey, wait a second....<br />
<br />
Broken Feelings: An adventure where the main character has a strange medical condition: His feelings are all mixed up. Sad things make him laugh, silly things make him scared, being surprised makes him feel contented and at peace etc etc.

				<div class="message">Yeah, I've got a million of 'em. Here's an idea I came up with as a video game I'd like to see, inspired by Mad Karate Man, but it could also work as a MSPA for the purposes of putting my ideas down.<br />
<br />
You are a chef at a five-star gourmet restaurant. You are also a black-belt martial artist. Your restaurant has quickly become the most popular in town, thanks to your methods of cooking that combine meals with dinner theatre - you apply the techniques you were taught at a thousand-year-old Buddhist temple to the world of food preparation.<br />
<br />
Essentially, it'd be a series of orders, which you'd prepare using outrageous kung fu moves focusing on speed, effeciency, and most of all, awesomeness. For example, if the customer orders foie gras, you're brought out a live goose. First, you have to fatten it up by drop-kicking food into its mouth and possibly restraining it so it doesn't get away. When it's ready, you get to beat it up, tear it in half (FATALITY!), take out its liver, and cook it with a hadoken. Oh, did we mention that all this time, you are being attacked by ninjas?<br />
<br />
Bonus rounds would have you beating up animal rights activists protesting your restaurant because you beat the shit out of the animals you serve instead of preparing already-humanely-slaughtered ones, like those <i>sissy</i> restaurants do.</div>

				<div class="message">I've had an idea boiling for a while, since I started reading the Thursday Next books, about a Jurisfiction division for the MSPFA forums. For those who haven't read the Thursday Next books (you should, they're great), Jurisfiction is a kind of police force that operates inside books, making sure things go as the plot dictates, and other general order-keeping in the BookWorld. Or in this case, the MSPFA part of the forums. Most of the agents are characters from classics, for the MSPFA version I guess a combination of original characters, MSPFA characters (with the owner's consent) and fan/background characters.<br />
<br />
Possible locations/plot points could be the main MSPFA forums, the Cradle, the various discussion threads, completed adventures/locked threads (harder to enter, but nothing can be changed as a result of their actions), the MSPFA Awards... Anything concerning the forums, I guess?</div>

							You are a crash-test dummy, and have recently aquired sentience and the ability to move your eyes, fingers and toes! Now using just this (plus the help of a friendly lab-rat from the next lab over) you must escape from the crash-test lab! ABSOLUTELY NO gaining the use of other body parts throughout the adventure, its eyes fingers and toes only! Well maybe he can gain a voice as well, that might help.<br />
<br />
Optional extra to the above: you spot through a window the town which your lab is on the outskirts of, and fall in love with a shop-window dummy.

Do you remember the mention of a previous &quot;super group&quot; before Robo was created by Nikola Tesla, involving Tesla, Houdini, Lovecraft Sr (and later H.P.Lovecraft himself), Annie Oakley, and several others? Do you often wonder about their shared secret history fighting weird science and other-worldly threats in the 1800s? Adventure opportunity, right there.

You are Rouge, the X-Men mutant who can't touch anybody with your skin for fear of what it'll do to them. You've just set up a splinter-institute to compliment Xavier's institute down the road. In your establishment, you take in and keep safe mutants with only the most extreme powers that make it difficult to even live normally, just like your skin thing.<br />
<br />
Amongst the interns are a girl with superhearing so powerful that it causes her physical pain to hear someone clap their hands, a man that can see visions of the future and the past but can't focus on the present, and a boy who experiences the pain and emotions of a murder if he goes too close to anywhere that's ever had a murder take place there. The newest intern is a baby that causes explosions, somehow?

							You live in a tiny village in the middle of a jungle, totally cut off from anywhere else, and you love it here. It is paradise. Suddenly, EXPLORERS. You don't want to be violent, but you must stop the explorers (with their fancy shoes and compasses) from ever finding your little piece of paradise and mapping it.

							So clones are a thing! After the initial shock, clones become as commonplace and normal as toasters. You can get a fully grown clone in 28 days, and the procedure can take place in any large-enough hospital. People are living with themselves as flatmates, or treating themselves as slaves (against the law but everyone does it anyway), or simply freezing them until the original dies! Also, pretty weird sexual shenanigans behind closed doors. <br />
<br />
Due to fear of overpopulation you're only allowed one clone of yourself, and NO modifications like an extra head or something (this is TOUGHLY regulated, pretty much impossible to break these rules), but that hasn't stopped some people trying to independently copy the cloning formula and conduct illegal experiments, with ugly results. None of the shady science guys have succeeded at copying the &quot;official&quot; technique. Yet.<br />
<br />
Think of this idea as a setting rather than a plot, other plot ideas can use this setting if they wish.

				<div class="message">So clones are a thing! After the initial shock, clones become as commonplace and normal as toasters. You can get a fully grown clone in 28 days, and the procedure can take place in any large-enough hospital. People are living with themselves as flatmates, or treating themselves as slaves (against the law but everyone does it anyway), or simply freezing them until the original dies! Also, pretty weird sexual shenanigans behind closed doors. <br />
<br />
Due to fear of overpopulation you're only allowed one clone of yourself, and NO modifications like an extra head or something (this is TOUGHLY regulated, pretty much impossible to break these rules), but that hasn't stopped some people trying to independently copy the cloning formula and conduct illegal experiments, with ugly results. None of the shady science guys have succeeded at copying the &quot;official&quot; technique. Yet.<br />
<br />
Think of this idea as a setting rather than a plot, other plot ideas can use this setting if they wish.</div>

</div>Ironically, I posted this on my Tumblr last week:<br />
<br />
<b><u>Microclimates</u></b><br />
HERE ARE SOME FREE FICTION IDEAS (BASED ON FACT) FOR ANY PASSING WRITER TO USE AS THEY SEE FIT<br />
<br />
From my hazy memories of Geography class, Microclimates are what happens when the shapes of man-made buildings affect the weather.<br />
<br />
Like for example, if you have a long narrow street with tall buildings on either side, it’s more likely for the wind to blow through this man-made tunnel in a straight line, meaning streets like this have a tendency towards blustery weather. Also I think there was an example about buildings with lots of big windows reflecting sunlight or something, but you can see what I mean though, right?<br />
<br />
What if a new town was secretly planned and built to affect the microclimates for miles around? With odd architectural features and things on top of buildings that are apparently “artistic”, but could be moved and adjusted to CONTROL those microclimates somehow? You’d have a very localised but powerful weather machine.<br />
<br />
What if we went the opposite way? What if there was a town somewhere with planners who’ve never heard of microclimates, but are constantly puzzled by the persistently weird weather in the area? A town where street names have changed over time to become “Rain Avenue” or “Snow Boulevarde”? Would you wanna live there?

						</p><h2>08-20-2012</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							OK, you know when your brain creates a fully formed plot seemingly out of nowhere? Be prepared for wall of text guys:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This plot is specifically set in author Terry Pratchett's Discworld setting. If you've never read any of the books, basically GTFO. Right. So our hero is a young up-and-coming thief in the Thieves Guild, but like a lot of the youngsters, he's a bit disillusioned with how theft is all legal and mostly pre-booked at the victim's convenience nowadays. He takes his frustration out at the Wallgame Guild Vs Guild tournaments put on by the Guild Of Assassins, and does surprisingly well. The fat-cat Guild heads of the Thieves notice his skills, and decide to test him by offering him a chance to do some old-school thieving for once!<br />
<br />
An eccentric billionaire just won't pay for Guild protection, so is fair game for his annual allowance of theft - only his personal wallet will do. Unfortunately, he has crazy loyal guards and lives in a crazy house built by infamous architect Bloody Stupid Johnson, the man who once re-invented Pi to do away with all those &quot;messy infinite numbers&quot;. Plus it's filled with crazy boobytraps. PLUS... there's a contract out on the guy's life, and an assassin just so happens to be storming the house on the same night. If our thief can't rob him before he's dead, Guild law will class him as a grave robber and an Undesirable, which is Bad. And the assassin would find it hard to prove he's killed this guy without either taking his head back (not ideal), or getting someone to witness it. Plus he's a bastard who cheated thief out of the Wallgame win earlier.<br />
<br />
So the thief and the assassin enter into a deal, a game. A race to their chosen goal, the &quot;winner&quot; go the spoils and the loser promises to back them up with time confirmation etc.

<br />
The magic will not return. How would an ex-wizard make sure his village strives and lives on without it? Would he turn to laughable &quot;science&quot;?

							A murder has takn place during a meeting at City Hall. As a detective inspector attending the meeting, you make sure no-one leaves the building and you start investigating. A little girl was hurt and traumatised during the attack, and whilst a local doctor tends to her wounds in an ante-room, she manages to give you brief clues to the killer's identity before intermittently lapsing into unconsciousness. Clues like &quot;it was a man&quot;, and &quot;he wasn't bald&quot;.<br />

							A kind-of collaborative adventure, like a round robin but different:<br />
<br />
So about 3 - 5 people agree to do the adventure together, the order of who goes first etc is decided randomly, then each person has exactly a week to do whatever they want with the adventure, as many updates as they like, before handing over to the next person who does their week however they like, and so on in a big loop.<br />

You can then watch the stories, make more characters, build/unlock different &quot;stage&quot; habitats...<br />

These threads are all about sharing creativity. Do you have a great idea for a forum adventure, but for some reason you can't/don't want to use it? Place it here for all to see, and someone might just adopt it and use it! Conversely, are you having trouble thinking of a plot idea for your new adventure? This thread is here to help! Skimming through all these lovely ideas may give you the vital flash of inspiration you so sorely need.<br />
<br />
There are no rules about what constitutes an idea for this thread. It could be just a mechanic on how an adventure should be created, like <b>&quot;an adventure with visuals created entirely using a camera and some cardboard toilet-roll tubes&quot;</b>, or even just a cool adventure name like <b>&quot;&quot;Citizen Kane 2: Rosebud's Revenge&quot;</b>.

							You have just become the President, and during your secret welcome-briefing you learn a horrible truth:<br />

NONE OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE TRUE! Not even Area 51! There was hardly any cool secret stuff to become aware of at all! (Apart from that whole Kennedy thing)<br />

							It is said that the gods play games with the fate of men. Imagine then the power that is held within the playing dice of the gods. What if these powerful dice were lost by Chance (he needs to look after his stuff better) and in a roundabout way, they made it onto a table at a small everyday casino?

							You are in a completely white void. Well it looks like that at first, but you're actually stood in the centre of an abandoned castle, but all the colours have been stolen from the walls, the floor, the surrounding sky, every single object. Even the grey from the shadows. The audience ideally won't know this at first, and the character has a drawing implement in their pocket so naturally people will suggest drawing on the &quot;void&quot;, only to be surprised when some of the drawing looks like it's not on a flat surface...
						</p><h2>09-06-2013</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							Adding to the previous idea: you unlock certain colours back into the world after a while, but at first you only get the lightest shades of grey, and almost-white pastels.
						</p><h2>09-07-2013</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>

							OK, like, the TV show Friends yeah, but entirely from the perspective of Ugly Naked Guy. And sometimes perspective shift to Gunther.

You are a young whywolf, but you hate the taste of house-people. The other whywolves insist that this means you are evolutionarily deficient and inform you that you can either choose to ignore it and survive, proving that your strength of will is a sufficient positive trait to overcome your negative mutation, or stop eating altogether and die. You disagree. You think that your personal mutation means that you should start a new pack and fill a different niche, one that eats something tastier. So you set out on a journey to find something you actually like the taste of. Your goal: Don't starve!</div>

						</p><h2>10-30-2013</h2><h1>OldManRupee</h1><p>
							You start as a rather plain adventurer, white t-shirt, jeans, short stick as a weapon, raiding a dungeon literally stuffed with treasure and monsters and tricks and puzzles. However most treasures are clothing, bracelets, accessories, hats, etc etc (and a few weapons) that you HAVE to wear because your inventory can only store one item. Maybe you find a small bag of holding later for jewels etc. This clothing system is how you &quot;level up&quot;, but the new clothes must be actually seen on the character's art/sprite! Eventually they are literally covered in layers of magical bling and looking DECADENT whilst slaying dragons etc.

							I've seen a few adventures where the main character has seen a creepy or weird or unnerving thing, and reacted either angrily or like &quot; not this again&quot; *shrug*. Personally I know that my true reaction to seeing something not-of-this-earth would be to stare at it completely frozen in fear with a cold flush running through my body, trying desperately to make sense of it somehow. So yeah, an adventure with more believable reactions please.<br />
<br />
(I know this would be my reaction because of the time I woke up in the middle of the night and managed to convince myself that the dressing gown hung on the back of my door was actually some sort of shadowy figure. It took me hours to unfreeze and cautiously poke it, half screaming inwardly as I went)

These threads are all about sharing creativity. Do you have a great idea for a forum adventure, but for some reason you can't/don't want to use it? Place it here for all to see, and someone might just adopt it and use it! Conversely, are you having trouble thinking of a plot idea for your new adventure? This thread is here to help! Skimming through all these lovely ideas may give you the vital flash of inspiration you so sorely need.<br />
<br />
<b>It doesn't have to be just plot ideas</b>. The &quot;Adventure Plots&quot; title is just there for tradition. Character ideas, unusual adventure mechanics, even fun-sounding adventure titles with no other info are welcome here! Basically, go for it.<br />
<br />
To help encourage people to use these ideas, I run a twice-yearly contest (with cool prizes!) challenging people to create new adventures using only the ideas from the thread. Below is a list of all the contest winners so far!<br />

				<div class="message">One day, aliens came down from outer space. They gave the head of the S.E.T.I. project, who has been unwittingly communicating with them, a large tome full of magical incantations. Then the aliens leave and never come back.<br />
<br />
Using the book, the man becomes Earth's first wizard. Despite the protestations of the D.O.D., he publishes his magical findings in a scientific journal. Like most scientists, he is more interested in winning a Nobel prize than ruling the world with an iron fist. Scientists everywhere begin learning magic. Soon, magic has become a major course curriculum in most universities. Physicists everywhere begin theorizing  and reworking the standard model, allowing for a new subatomic particle called a magicule. They refurbish and repurpose the large hadron collider to find magicules, and the scientific community is anxiously awaiting the day when it does.<br />
<br />
You are a young postgrad student, trying to earn your doctorate in magiphysics. This is an exciting time to be working on a doctoral dissertation, because everything is new and in flux and wild ideas are welcomed and praised. In your excitement, you share the basis of your dissertation (as yet unspecified because I can't think of anything) to your roommate, who promptly steals your idea. Now you must get it back by magicking his memory of it away, however he is a powerful physizard and it's going to be hard, especially now that he is breaking into the L.H.C. to try and prove your hypothesis and claim it for himself. You must break in also, and either prove it yourself before he gets to it, or defeat him in a magic battle while being careful not to damage the L.H.C.</div>

</div>I thought about joining an online D&amp;D group once but I didn't know how time differences would work? So I was thinking of devising a narcoleptic monk that every time I had to be &quot;away from computer&quot;, my character would fall asleep and be cursed to become as stiff and sturdy as a board. That way I could drop back in and see how he was doing, waking up to realise he's in the middle of being used as a bridge or a battering ram or something. I never did join that group in the end.

These threads are all about sharing creativity. Do you have a great idea for a forum adventure, but for some reason you can't/don't want to use it? Place it here for all to see, and someone might just adopt it and use it! Conversely, are you having trouble thinking of a plot idea for your new adventure? This thread is here to help! Skimming through all these lovely ideas may give you the vital flash of inspiration you so sorely need.<br />
<br />
<b>It doesn't have to be just plot ideas.</b> The &quot;Adventure Plots&quot; title is just there for tradition. Character ideas, unusual adventure mechanics, even fun-sounding adventure titles with no other info are welcome here! Basically, go for it.<br />
<br />
To help encourage people to use these ideas, I run a regular contest (with cool prizes!) challenging people to create new adventures using only the ideas from the thread. Below is a list of all the contest winners so far!<br />
