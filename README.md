Hi, I am Cadorean on the MSPA Forums and n0c00l on tumblr. I made this search engine as a utility for managing the many, many Adventure Plots Up For Grabs entries. Hopefully this can be utilized by U4G contest entrants to streamline the prompt choosing process, as well as the many people who already use the Up For Grabs thread for all their other adventures.

To use the search engine simply run the python script by double clicking, and wait for the archive to load -- this should be rather quick. The longest part is fetching each page of thread 4 and loading them to the index.

Once it has finished archiving, you have three options for search criteria: Username of poster, keywords within the post, and date range of when it was posted. None of the searches are case sensitive, so don't worry if you can't remember how Chwoka formatted his text for that one search. Punctuation and spelling in searches do matter though -- for what it's worth, just avoid punctuation unless absolutely necessary. Date range is inclusive of your given dates.

The date range search may not work where you are, and I do apologise. I live in the States, and the way vBulletin formats dates for me is MM-DD-YYYY. I wrote the date search with this in mind, so if vBulletin formats dates differently depending on region it'll break the date range search on thread 4, or all of them if you recompile the archive where you live.
